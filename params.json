Or, open a terminal and run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iggyvolz/ToSFixer/master/ToSFixer) (the first line is optional).\r\n\r\nThat's it.  Town of Salem should work for Steam.\r\n\r\nFix originally reported [here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/334230/discussions/0/451848854979175841/#p4) by Dam.\r\n\r\nDepending on your system, you may encounter one or both of the issues below - following the instructions should get your Steam back to normal (along with Town of Salem) within just a few minutes.\r\n\r\n## Issues and how to respond to them ##\r\n\r\n### The application \"Steam\" can't be opened -600 ###\r\nRestart your computer.  Upon reinstall, Steam will have to re-update.\r\n\r\n### Failed to load steamui.dylib ###\r\nRe-install Steam - drag /Applications/Steam.app to trash (optionally empty trash to save space), and re-download Steam from steampowered.com (or if you use Homebrew Cask: brew install steam --force).  Your games will not need to be reinstalled.\r\n\r\n### I just give up on the app - is there another way? ###\r\n\r\nYou can run the fix manually by opening a Terminal session (press the magnifying glass in the top-right and search Terminal), and running the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\neval `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iggyvolz/ToSFixer/master/ToSFixer`\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to see the script as you're doing it:\r\n```\r\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Town\\ of\\ Salem/TownOfSalem.app/Contents/Frameworks/Adobe\\ AIR.framework\r\ncd Versions\r\n[ -f Current ] && rm Current\r\nln -s 1.0/ Current\r\ncd ..\r\n[ -f Resources ] && rm Resources\r\n[ -f Adobe\\ AIR ] && rm Adobe\\ AIR\r\nln -s Versions/Current/Resources .\r\nln -s Versions/Current/Adobe\\ AIR .\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
